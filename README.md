# About

I'm an avid reader, which includes books, audiobooks, etc. I enjoy tracking my library, what books I read when, and set annual reading challenges for myself. I've used apps such as Goodreads to track things, but it hasn't quite been the experience that I'm looking for.

I decided to start this project to create the type of personal library tracker that I want to have and it is also a place for me to play with tech as a software engineer.

I just have the backend going for now, which I test by using Postman. I'm working to get a front end going and will likely have two front ends - one Vue and one React. I'll link to those repos in the near future.

This is very much a work-in-progress.
